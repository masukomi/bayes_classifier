# naive

Naive Bayes classifier for Crystal (based on [muatik's classifier](https://github.com/muatik/naive-bayes-classifier)).

Note: the tokenizer that comes with this library is designed for English.

Notable Tokenizer limitations:

* No stripping of non-English punctuation (by default).
* Doesn't correctly tokenize languages that don't separated words with spaces.

## Installation


Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  gsl:
    github: ruivieira/naivebayes
```


## Usage


```crystal
require "naive"

tokeniser = Naive::Tokeniser.new

newsTrainer = Naive::Trainer.new(tokeniser)

newsSet = [
  {"text" => "not to eat too much is not enough to lose weight", "category" => "health"},
  {"text" => "Russia try to invade Ukraine", "category" => "politics"},
  {"text" => "do not neglect exercise", "category" => "health"},
  {"text" => "Syria is the main issue, Obama says", "category" => "politics"},
  {"text" => "eat to lose weight", "category" => "health"},
  {"text" => "you should not eat much", "category" => "health"},
]

newsSet.each { |news|
  newsTrainer.train(news["text"], news["category"])
}

newsClassifier = Naive::Classifier.new(newsTrainer.data, tokeniser)

classification = newsClassifier.classify("Obama is")

puts classification # => {"health" => 1.6666666666666666e-10, "politics" => 0.083333333333333329}
```
